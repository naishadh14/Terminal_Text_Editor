Text Editor

The editor can read an existing file and display it on the screen. It can make changes it and can save the modified version (in some cases, if save couldn't work, an error message is shown).
It can handle Tab and Enter keys while reading and inserting into the file. Scrolling and Resizing also work to some extent (a few bugs remain). The text wraps around the resized window as would be expected.
The program actually works on a copy of the existing file and the changes are written back to the original file when the user saves (using F2). 
The data structure used is a 2D array.
